His competitiveness was visible in his prolific trash-talk and well-known work ethic. As the Bulls organization built the franchise around Jordan, management had to trade away players who were not \"tough enough\" to compete with him in practice. To help improve his defense, he spent extra hours studying film of opponents. On offense, he relied more upon instinct and improvisation at game time. Noted as a durable player, Jordan did not miss four or more games while active for a full season from 1986\u201387 to 2001\u201302, when he injured his right knee.

Point guards are expected to run the team's offense by controlling the ball and making sure that it gets to the right player at the right time. Above all, the point guard must totally understand and accept their coach's game plan; in this way, the position can be compared to a quarterback in American football or a playmaker in association football (soccer). While the point guard must understand and accept the coach's gameplan, they must also be able to adapt to what the defense is allowing, and they also must control the pace of the game.\n"

          "text": "The 1998\u201399 NBA season was the Raptors' fourth season in the National Basketball Association. In the 1998 NBA draft, the Raptors selected Antawn Jamison out of the University of North Carolina with the fourth overall pick. However, they traded Jamison to the Golden State Warriors for his college teammate Vince Carter, who is also second-year star Tracy McGrady's cousin. During the offseason, the team acquired Charles Oakley from the New York Knicks, and Kevin Willis from the Houston Rockets. During the regular season, which was shortened due to a four-month lockout, the Raptors moved into their new arena Air Canada Centre. After a 6\u201312 start, the Raptors played their best basketball winning 12 of their next 14 games. However, they lost 13 of their final 18 games, and finished the season with a 23\u201327 record, sixth in the Central Division. Carter averaged 18.3 points per game and was named Rookie of the Year. Following the season, John Wallace re-signed as a free agent with the New York Knicks.\n"
